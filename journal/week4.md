##  Script to dynamically update the RDS inbound security group 

here is the code that when run, will get the new gitpod env IP address and updade the RDS security group that controle the inbound traffic
``` shell
#! /usr/bin/bash

# Define color variables
GREEN='\033[0;32m'
NC='\033[0m' # No Color

export DB_SG_ID="sg-01e7f8e34bfd1fdfb"
gp env DB_SG_ID="sg-01e7f8e34bfd1fdfb"

export DB_SG_RULE_ID="sgr-0d1a09047705b5874"
gp env DB_SG_RULE_ID="sgr-0d1a09047705b5874"

echo -e "${GREEN}=====RDS-update-aws-rds-postgre-sg-rule${NC}"

GITPOD_IP=$(curl ifconfig.me)

echo GITPOD_IP $GITPOD_IP 

aws ec2 modify-security-group-rules \
    --group-id $DB_SG_ID \
    --security-group-rules "SecurityGroupRuleId=$DB_SG_RULE_ID,SecurityGroupRule={Description=GITPOD,IpProtocol=tcp,FromPort=5432,ToPort=5432,CidrIpv4=$GITPOD_IP/32}"

##  Lambda fuction to insert new user in RDS table 

had this lamda function attached to my cognito user pole, that will be run every time a new user in confirmed in our user pool. the purpose of that lambda function is to insert the newly confirm user in the rds users table.
in order for my lambda funtion to accesst my RDS, I have to got attached this IAM policy "AWSLambdaVPCAccessExecutionRole" to the role attached to my lambda, so that my lambda could have access to all the ressource within mu VPC, and I also have to add my lambda fucton to the same VPC, subnet as my RDD 

``` python
import json
import psycopg2
import os

def lambda_handler(event, context):
    user = event['request']['userAttributes']
    print('userAttributes')
    print(user)

    user_display_name  = user['name']
    user_email         = user['email']
    user_handle        = user['preferred_username']
    user_cognito_id    = user['sub']
    try:
     
      sql = f"""
         INSERT INTO public.users (
          display_name, 
          email,
          handle, 
          cognito_user_id
          ) 
        VALUES(
          '{user_display_name}', 
          '{user_email}', 
          '{user_handle}', 
          '{user_cognito_id}'
        )
      """
      print('SQL Statement ----')
      print(sql)
      print('CONNECTION_URL Statement ----')
      print(os.getenv('CONNECTION_URL'))
      conn = psycopg2.connect(os.getenv('CONNECTION_URL'))
      cur = conn.cursor()
      cur.execute(sql)
      conn.commit() 

    except (Exception, psycopg2.DatabaseError) as error:
      print(error)
    finally:
      if conn is not None:
          cur.close()
          conn.close()
          print('Database connection closed.')
    return event
